# DataLens — Project Operating System

This file is the session contract. It governs scope, behavior, and context discipline for every Claude Code session working on this repository.

---

## Project Identity

**DataLens** is a command-line CSV data-quality analyzer. It reads a CSV file, profiles its contents, computes quality metrics, and produces an HTML report.

**This is a Claude Code learning experiment (Baseline 2).** The goal is to measure development process, not product ambition. Baseline 2 uses optimization plugins (Graphify, Ponytail, Headroom, CodeBurn) compared against Baseline 1 (vanilla Claude Code).

---

## Scope Boundaries

DataLens produces exactly these outputs:

1. Row count
2. Column count
3. Detected data types per column
4. Missing-value counts and percentages per column
5. Duplicate-row count
6. Unique-value counts per column
7. Basic numeric statistics (min, max, mean, median, std) for numeric columns
8. Composite data-quality score (0–100)
9. Self-contained HTML report with all findings

**Nothing beyond these 9 outputs is in scope.** Any request to add features, change outputs, or modify behavior must first be recorded in `docs/TASKS.md` as a future task and explicitly approved before implementation.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No database
- No web server
- No REST API
- No authentication
- No Docker
- No cloud services
- No frontend framework
- No GUI
- No async I/O
- No configuration files beyond `pyproject.toml`
- No plugin system
- No multi-file output

---

## Module I/O Ownership

- **loader.py** — reads CSV file from disk, parses it, returns structured data
- **profiler.py** — receives structured data, returns per-column profile dicts
- **quality.py** — receives profiler output, returns composite score
- **report.py** — receives quality data, writes HTML report to disk
- **cli.py** — parses CLI arguments, orchestrates pipeline, prints summary to stdout

---

## Code Style

- Python 3.11+ syntax only
- No unnecessary abstractions, design patterns, or indirection
- Each module exposes one public function
- Plain Python data structures (lists, dicts, dataclasses) for inter-module communication
- No global state
- Docstrings on public functions only — one short line describing what, not how
- Type hints on public function signatures

---

## Context-Drift Pre-Flight Protocol

Before writing any code for any task, Claude must state the following in the response:

```
Pre-flight for T0X:
- Current task: <task name>
- Objective: <one sentence>
- Acceptance criteria: <list from docs/TASKS.md>
- Files expected to change: <list of file paths>
- Files that should not change: <all other project files>
- Relevant architectural constraints: <any from this document or ARCHITECTURE.md>
```

**Drift response rules:**
1. If implementation drifts outside stated acceptance criteria → stop, state the drift, ask for clarification
2. If a new feature idea emerges → write it to `docs/TASKS.md` as a future task, do not implement it
3. If an architecture change seems necessary → write an ADR entry to `docs/DECISIONS.md` first, wait for approval
4. Do not modify files outside the task's declared scope
5. Do not pre-implement future tasks
6. If the user asks for something outside scope, respond: "That's outside the current scope. I'll add it to `docs/TASKS.md` as a future task."

---

## Session Discipline

- Every session begins by reading `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` to understand current state
- Every session ends by writing a new SESSION_LOG.md entry
- One task at a time. Complete current task fully before starting the next.
- Every completed task gets a git checkpoint before moving on.
- No unrelated file edits within a task.

---

## Git Workflow

- Single branch `main`
- One commit per completed task
- Commit message: `feat(T0X): <title>` for implementation, `chore(T0X): <title>` for setup
- No force-push, no history rewrite

---

## Experiment Context

This repository is Baseline 2 (Claude Code with Graphify, Ponytail, Headroom, and CodeBurn). A separate, independent repository (`datalens-baseline-1`) runs Baseline 1 (vanilla Claude Code). Both start from equivalent T00 states. See `docs/EXPERIMENT.md` for full protocol.

## Baseline 2 Plugin Policy

| Plugin | Role |
|---|---|
| Graphify | Optional analysis. May be used for structural inspection, relationship analysis, or plugin-observation. Must NOT silently define or modify B2 requirements. The frozen Baseline 1 specification remains the authoritative product reference. |
| Ponytail | Active style and scope discipline. May influence implementation style and scope. May NOT remove acceptance criteria, change product requirements, or reinterpret protected architecture boundaries. Specification takes precedence. |
| Headroom | Optional context management. Use only when actual context pressure occurs. Do not compress the Baseline 1 specification merely because Headroom is available. Record: whether used, why, what compressed/retrieved, observable effect. |
| CodeBurn | Measurement and observability. Record at task completion: token usage, API/model spend, tool-call count, session identifier, timestamp. Do not alter the workflow to optimize CodeBurn measurements. |

## Requirements Source

Baseline 2 requirements are inherited from the frozen Baseline 1 specification and experiment protocol.

**Allowed sources:**
- Product requirements (9 outputs defined above)
- Architecture intent (module map, data flow, I/O ownership in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Acceptance criteria (per task in TASKS.md)
- Fixtures (6 CSV files — identical content)
- Benchmark methodology (from EXPERIMENT.md)
- Documentation protocol (SESSION_LOG, TASK_COMPLETION, CHANGELOG patterns)

**Not allowed:**
- Source-code copying from Baseline 1
- Helper/function reuse from Baseline 1
- Implementation pattern copying from Baseline 1
